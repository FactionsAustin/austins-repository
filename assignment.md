### Winter Wonderland Lyrics - Austin
***Winter Wonderland***
*"Winter Wonderland"* is a song written in 1934 by Felix Bernard and lyricist Richard Bernhard Smith. Due to its seasonal theme, it is often regarded as a Christmas song in the Northern Hemisphere. Since its original recording by Richard Himber, it has been covered by over 200 different artists. Its lyrics are about a couple's romance during the winter season.

A later version of *"Winter Wonderland"* (which was printed in 1947) included a "new children's lyric" that transformed it "from a romantic winter interlude to a seasonal song about playing in the snow". The snowman mentioned in the song's bridge was changed from Parson Brown to a circus clown, and the promises the couple made in the final verse were replaced with lyrics about frolicking. Singers like Johnny Mathis connected both versions, adding a verse and chorus.

**Lyrics:**

**Verse 1:**

*Sleigh bells ring, are you listenin'*

*In the lane, snow is glistening*

*A beautiful sight, we're happy tonight*

*Walking in a winter wonderland*

**Verse 2:**

*Gone away is the blue bird*

*Here to stay is the new bird*

*He's singing our song, as we go along*

*Walking in a winter wonderland*

**Verse 3:**

*In the meadow we can build a snowman*

*Then pretend that he is Carson Brown*

*He'll say "Are you married?", We'll say "No man,*

*But you can do the job when you're in town."*

**Verse 4:**

*Later on, we'll conspire*

*As we dream by the fire*

*To face unafraid, the plans that we made*

*Walking in a winter wonderland*

**Verse 5:**

*In the meadow we can build a snowman*

*And pretend that he's a circus clown*

*We'll have lots of fun with Mr.Snowman*

*Until the other kiddies knock him down*

**Verse 6:**

*When it snows, ain't it thrillin'*
*Though you know, kids are chillin'*

*We'll frolic and play, the Eskimo way*

*Walking in a winter wonderland (wo oh oh)*

*Walking in a winter wonderland (wo oh oh)*

*Walking in a winter wonderland (wo oh oh)*

*Walking in a winter wonderland (wo oh oh)*

*Walking in a winter wonderland (wo oh oh)*

*Walking in a winter wonderland*
