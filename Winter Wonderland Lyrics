### Winter Wonderland Lyrics - Austin
Winter Wonderland
By: Darlene Love

Sleigh bells ring, are you listenin'
In the lane, snow is glistening
A beautiful sight, we're happy tonight
Walking in a winter wonderland

Gone away is the blue bird
Here to stay is the new bird
He's singing our song, as we go along
Walking in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
Then pretend that he is Carson Brown
He'll say "Are you married?", We'll say "No man,
But you can do the job when you're in town."

Later on, we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid, the plans that we made
Walking in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he's a circus clown
We'll have lots of fun with Mr.Snowman
Until the other kiddies knock him down

When it snows, ain't it thrillin'
Though you know, kids are chillin'
We'll frolic and play, the Eskimo way
Walking in a winter wonderland (wo oh oh)
Walking in a winter wonderland (wo oh oh)
Walking in a winter wonderland (wo oh oh)
Walking in a winter wonderland (wo oh oh)
Walking in a winter wonderland (wo oh oh)
Walking in a winter wonderland
